<h4>PERSONALIZED AND INTERACTIVE DEMENTED CARE AND LEARNING MATE WITH VIRTUAL SYSTEM USING EMOTION RECOGNITION</h4><br>
<h5>Main Objective</h5><br>
<p>CREATE PERSONALIZED AND INTERACTIVE DEMENTED CARE AND LEARNING MATE WITH VIRTUAL SYSTEM USING EMOTION RECOGNITION SYSTEM</p><br>
<h5>Main Research questions</h5><br>
<p>The main research question of personalized and interactive demented care and learning mate with virtual system using emotion recognition is how effective the implementation of an interactive learning mate with virtual system using emotion recognition could be for providing personalized care for people with dementia.</p><br>
<h5>Individual research questions</h5><br>
<p>1.The research question of demented care persons’ restricted area detection and tracking system using machine learning, GPS technology, and cameras is how effective can the integration of these technologies be in improving the safety and security of demented care persons by detecting and tracking their movements within restricted areas.<br>
   <br>2.The main research question of face emotion and voice emotion detection using machine learning is: "Can we accurately detect emotions from facial expressions and voice using machine learning algorithms, and how can we use this technology to improve mental health diagnosis and treatment?"

This research aims to develop automated tools for emotion detection that can assist mental health professionals in diagnosing and treating patients. By accurately detecting emotions from facial expressions and voice, machine learning algorithms can provide insights into patients' mental states and help practitioners develop personalized treatment plans. This technology has the potential to improve the accessibility and affordability of mental health care while ensuring that patients receive more accurate and timely diagnoses.<br><br>
   3.The main research question of this study is: How can an IoT device be used to monitor the health of individuals in real-time and notify their guardians or caretakers of any changes in their health status?<br>
